# TF2 internal cheat written in [Rust]

This was written in 2021, releasing it now because it no longer works without modifications, I don't want to give anyone the impression I condone cheating in online video games.

## Why

I wanted to know if it was viable to write an internal cheat written entirely in rust. Is it? I think so.

## Checklist

- [-] Implement triggerbot
- [x] Implement some sort of visual ESP
- [x] Use some type of hook
- [-] Add something unique (maybe something to do with replays)

## Restrictions

- Must be coded in rust in its entirety, relying on no c/c++ bindings to show its capable to do everything required without leaning on bindings.
